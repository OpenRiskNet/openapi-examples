# API Examples

## OpenRiskNet Example OpenAPI Definitions

To understand the degree to which APIs from various partners can be aligned and to find good candidates for annotation in the semantic interoperability layer, the ORN partners collect OpenAPI definitions for various services in this repository.

Partner API examples are located in the [partner_apis](partner_apis) directory.

To add new service descriptions, please create a folder for your organization in the partner-apis directory  and put your OpenAPI or similar API description information in there (API description only, no source code or similar).

## Dataset Annotation Examples

Examples of annotating datasets are located in the [data_examples](data_examples) directory. New examples should be added as new sub-directories.
