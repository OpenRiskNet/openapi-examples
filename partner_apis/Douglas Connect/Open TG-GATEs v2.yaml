  title: "Open TG-GATEs interface (Assay information, sample information and assay values for these)"
  description: |
    This API exposes Open TG-GATEs toxicogenomics data.
   
     Open TG-GATEs is a public toxicogenomics database based on the Japanese Toxicogenomics Projects (TGP and TGP2),
     developed so that a wider community of researchers could utilize the fruits of this research. 
     This API provides access to the RNA microarray (Affymetrix) samples from Open TG-GATEs.
     Rat data (in vitro, primary hepatocytes, and in vivo, liver and kidney), as well as human data 
     (in vitro) is provided, for repeat and single doses.
