# Jaqpot Quatro Modelling APIs

## Overview

JaqpotQuatro.yaml contains a subset of JaqpotQuatro web services found  [here](http://dev.jaqpot.org:8081/jaqpot/swagger/),
that contain the web services closely related to the use cases described in OpenRiskNet.

Its validity as a .yaml file was tested by the [Swagger Online Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/#/). At that point you can
also generate (semi-automatically) server and client instances that satisfy the OpenAPI definition.
